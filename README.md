statinference-031 project 1

This short project will study the Central Limit Theorem using simulated calls of the exponential distribution. 
It will:

  * show that the sample mean converges to the theoretical mean of the distribution
  * compare the sample variance to the theoretical variance of the distribution
  * show that the distribution is approximately normal
